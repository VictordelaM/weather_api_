Weather App README

Welcome to the Weather App repository! This simple web application allows you to check the current weather for any city. The project is built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.



Code Overview



HTML (index.html)

The HTML file defines the structure of the webpage, including input fields, buttons, and information display areas. It integrates seamlessly with the JavaScript and CSS files

JavaScript (assets/js/main.js)

The JavaScript file contains the logic for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updating the content on the webpage. It includes features like real-time clock updates and interval handling.

CSS (assets/css/style.css)

The CSS file provides a global styling theme with attention to detail. Fonts from the Roboto family are imported, and the layout is carefully crafted to ensure a pleasant visual experience. The design is responsive and user-friendly.

Customization

Feel free to customize the application by modifying the API key, adjusting the styling in the CSS file, or enhancing the features in the JavaScript code.
